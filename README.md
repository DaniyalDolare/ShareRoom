# ShareRoom

ShareRoom is a web application that allows you to quickly create a room where you can send text or files to anyone who joins the room. It promotes anonymity by not requiring users to share personal information such as phone numbers or email addresses. The rooms created in ShareRoom have a default duration of 10 minutes, ensuring that the content shared is temporary and not stored indefinitely. 

## Features

- **Create Rooms**: With ShareRoom, you can easily create a room where you can share text or files with others. Simply create a new room and start sharing.

- **Anonymity**: ShareRoom values your privacy. It does not require any personal information from users, ensuring that you can share content without revealing your identity.

- **Unique Room Codes**: Each room in ShareRoom is assigned a unique code. You can share this code with others, allowing them to join the room and access the shared content.

- **Automatic Room Expiration**: To maintain privacy and ensure that content is not stored indefinitely, rooms in ShareRoom are set to expire after 10 minutes by default. This ensures that shared information is temporary and does not linger online.

## Future Scope

ShareRoom is an evolving project, and there are plans to add more features in the future. Some of the potential enhancements include:

- **Private/Password-Protected Rooms**: Implementing the ability to create private or password-protected rooms, allowing users to restrict access to invited participants only.

- **Room Customization**: Adding options to customize the appearance and settings of rooms, such as changing the room duration or enabling/disabling certain features.

## Getting Started

To get started with ShareRoom, you can visit the [ShareRoom website](https://share-room-ab265.web.app/) and create a new room. Share the unique room code with others to invite them to join the room and start sharing content.
